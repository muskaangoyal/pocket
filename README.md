## <a name ="intro"></a> Introduction
* In this project, we attempt to create a financial application which utilises IBM Z to update and analyze users' budget allocations in real-time based on spending patterns and provides relevant daily insights into federal and campus resources. We implement this idea using user-user collaborative filtering and recommending algorihtm.  

* Note: Pocket was created during IBM X DSS Datathon for Social Good in November 2019 by Muskaan Goyal, Ewen Dai, Gayatri Babel and Huiyi Zhang. Pocket won the **first prize** in the datathon.

## <a name ="lim"></a> Limitations
**1. Past Financial Constraints**: The algorithms depends on past financial budget and spending. As we wouldn't have past budget for new users, the quality and quantity of tips can vary depending on the user.

**2. Qaulity and Quantity of Tips**: To release new recommendations regularly for the users we need a good quantity of tips while mainting their quality.
